                <h3> What's the red scarf?</h3>
                <p class="text">In plenty of Taylor Swift's songs, she mentions the 'red scarf', often in a context of losing it, and of her ex boyfriend (Jake Gyllenhal), still having it. Although she hasn't confirmed anything, fans think of the red scarf as Swfit's virginity. Most of this references can be heard on the Red Album.</p>

                <h4>Who is Scooter Braun and  why do we hate him?</h4>
                <p class="text"> Scooter Braun purchased Taylor's old record firm 'Big Machine Records', and refused to sell her the rights of the songs she had recorded in it. Forced her to not perform any of those songs for 5 years, and sold her songs to a no-body. Ugh.</p>

                <h3> What happened on April 29th?</h3>
                <p class="text"> Quoting jam 'High Infidelity', Taylor aludes April 29th as the date she and ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris were done, as he disrespected her in an interview. A few days after, she was spotted in the Met Gala, dancing with Tom Hiddlestion a.k.a Loki. It's been rumored she cheated on Harris with Tom.</p>

                <h4>What is Taylor's Version?</h4>
                <p class="text"> After Taylor lost rights of all of her albums recorded with Big Machine Records (contract issues), she re-recorded some of them.
                    At the moment, Fearless and Red, and Speak Now rumored to be on its way. This means, when you look for those albums, PLEASE, listen to Taylor's Version, as she isn't receiving
                    any of the proceeds of the original ones.</p>
